The dashboard provides an insightful overview, allowing users to explore correlations between risk factors and heart attacks. It includes visualizations that depict the relationships between age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, diabetes, family history, lifestyle habits (such as smoking, obesity, alcohol consumption, exercise), stress levels, medication usage, and previous heart problems with the risk of experiencing a heart attack.
Moreover, geographical insights are available, highlighting potential regional influences on heart attack risk based on continent, country, and hemisphere data.
