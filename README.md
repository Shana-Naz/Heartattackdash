# Heart Attack Risk Prediction Dashboard In Power BI
# INTRODUCTION
The Power BI dashboard on heart attack risk offers a comprehensive analysis of various factors contributing to the likelihood of a heart attack. 
It utilizes a diverse dataset encompassing patient demographics, lifestyle choices, health metrics, and geographical details. The dashboard provides an insightful overview, allowing users to explore correlations between risk factors and heart attacks. It includes visualizations that depict the relationships between age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, diabetes, family history, lifestyle habits (such as smoking, obesity, alcohol consumption, exercise), stress levels, medication usage, and previous heart problems with the risk of experiencing a heart attack.
